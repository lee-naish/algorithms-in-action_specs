Student project ideas for Sem 2 2025

AVL tree polishing + maybe BST
AVL: show recursion with boxes, change other highlighting, tree
redrawing smoother, iterative???,...
Recursive BST (same as AVL minus last two lines of code).
...

"UI": main menu, list(s) of algorithms, colors

Simple algorithms, eg, demo recursion, bad complexity

World peace
