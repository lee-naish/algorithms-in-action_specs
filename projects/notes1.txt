Prim's to new graph layout + common structure (Real done, might need
minor fixes)

Warshall to new graph layout

Kruskal's (Real done)

Recursive DFS (Real done)

Hashing (Real mostly done for LP and double hashing)

mergesort for arrays TD, BUP (Real need overview for BUP)

Real needed for the following:

other balanced trees?

mergesort for lists?

minimax, alpha-beta? 


pre 2023s2 ---------------------------------------------------------------

DONE: 234 trees (Real ready to go)
then...?

UF DONE: Union-find (Real ready to go)
then Kruscal's? or same group does Union-find and 234 trees and another does
Kruscal's (eg graph layout group)?

Hashing (Real status?)

QS DONE: Quicksort recursion
then mergesort TD/BUP... (Real needs to be done)
(idea is to start with ~working code and get the recursive stuff working
better because a very similar structure is used for TD mergesort)

LAYOUT DONE: Graph layout - can start with current version of Prim's
then...? New version of Prim's perhaps and document interface/conversion
well??? New version of Prim's should be like Dijkstra etc

DONE (not Prims): Graph search etc: Prim's, BFS, DFS?, Dijkstra, A*
(could possibly start with current graph layout from Prim's then later
convert; leave Prim's for graph layout group; if so, maybe start with
Dijkstra)


For intern:
DONE: Bug fixing etc: forward then back == noop, visibility of vars etc that are not
visible in pseudocode, ...? (may need more data structures/methods/guidelines)
