234 trees (Real ready to go)
then...?

Union-find (Real ready to go)
then Kruscal's? or same group does Union-find and 234 trees and another does
Kruscal's (eg graph layout group)?

Hashing (Real status?)

Quicksort recursion
then mergesort TD/BUP... (Real needs to be done)
(idea is to start with ~working code and get the recursive stuff working
better because a very similar structure is used for TD mergesort)

Graph layout - can start with current version of Prim's
then...? New version of Prim's perhaps and document interface/conversion
well??? New version of Prim's should be like Dijkstra etc

Graph search etc: Prim's, BFS, DFS?, Dijkstra, A*
(could possibly start with current graph layout from Prim's then later
convert; leave Prim's for graph layout group; if so, maybe start with
Dijkstra)


For intern:
Bug fixing etc: forward then back == noop, visibility of vars etc that are not
visible in pseudocode, ...? (may need more data structures/methods/guidelines)
