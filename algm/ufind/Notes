Union-Find

Have array representation plus forest displayed

Fixed size of 20 might be sufficient

Use ranks (not size) and path halving; discuss other options

for forest, have one element per column (number + rank below with less
visual impact + maybe invisible at some levels of abstraction), each
tree in sorted order and trees sorted on roots(?)

Maybe have button to eliminate path compression so students can explore
what happens
