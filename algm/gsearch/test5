Bigger example better for layout sensitive weights; could change
weights above to illustrate different algorithms better.
After much experimentation, this illustrates non-optimality of
inadmissible heuristics:
gcc -DALGORITHM=4 -DWEIGHT=2 -DHEURISTIC=1 gsearch.c -lm
versus
gcc -DALGORITHM=4 -DWEIGHT=2 -DHEURISTIC=2 gsearch.c -lm
(actually, *rounded* Euclidean/HEURISTIC=2 is not admissible either due
to rounding): 45 degree line with nodes at each point has weight one
per edge (1.41 is rounded down) but if we skip a node the weight is 3
(2.82 is rounded up). Now using ceiling for Euclid - thats avoids this
problem.
